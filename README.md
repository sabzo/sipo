# Sipo  -  Sinatra MongoDB Starter Code

## API
Sipo uses Sinatra framework, warden for Authentication
[Warden](http://github.com/hassox/warden) and MongoDB for storage.

This is simply minimalistic starter code to be used for a simple Ruby MongoDB web-app.
## Usage (in irb shell for example)

```ruby
 # BEFORE ANYTHING set up Environment Varaibles for MongoDB connection!! -- mongoconnect.rb
example connection to mongo cluser:
`export URI= 'mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority'`
 # Can simply use a Rack Server to run or in irb for example you can do the following
 # include the API starting point
 require_relative 'app'

 # Creates a new user and encrypts the plaintext password
 u = User.new( {email: 'email@example.com', password: 'plainText'})

 # Create a new user and save (insert) into database
 u1 = User.new( {email: 'email@example.com', password: 'plainText'}).insert()

 # get Email or User of this object is simple as using the fields of the object
 u1.email # returns email@example.com

 u1.password # returns $2a$10$NyxVqdcX8gD4a1kuFhoRuO6ZiH6sklRjFYjAywWllbW7HZ910FgFm

 # Retrieve a User from the Database and return a user object
 u2 = User.new().find_one( {email: 'email4@example.com'} )

 # Remove a user (or any other object from a collection) ex:
 r = User.new({_id: '569809fda2dc7acb80000000'}).remove_one()

# Update a User by an email address
# If no key is passed in (1st param to `update()`) then Api will use internal @id
# When updating, an @id must already exist (since the doc was created & saved to DB)
u = User.new().update({email: 's@s'}, {email: 's@m'})

# Remove a user (or any other object from a collection) ex:
r = User.new({_id: '569809fda2dc7acb80000000'}).remove_one()

# Update a User by an email address
# If no key is passed in (1st param to `update()`) then Api will use internal @id
# When updating, an @id must already exist (since the doc was created & saved to DB)
u = User.new({email: 's@s'}).update({}, {email: 's@m'})
